In the 15-24 age group, men had higher participation rates than women. Specifically, 52.8% of men were active, compared with 47.7% of women. After this, men's participation fell in the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups, before increasing in the later groups. Participation among men increased to about 45% in the 45-54 and 55-64 age groups.

In the 35-44 age group, women were more active than men. For example, 52.5% of women were active, compared with 39.5% of men. Female participation remained stable in the middle-aged groups before slightly declining among those aged 65 and over.

The maps show the centre of a small town called Islip as it is now, and plans for its development.

Overall, the town centre is expected to become more modern and better organised, with the introduction of a pedestrian-only area, new facilities and additional housing. The road system will also be significantly improved.

At present, the main road runs through the centre of the town, with shops located on both sides. To the north of the road lies countryside, while housing areas are found to the south. There is also a school in the south-west and a part to the east of the residential area.

Under the proposed development, the main road will be replaced by a circular dual carriageway surrounding the town centre. Inside this ring road, the central area will be designated for pedestrians only. A shopping centre will be built in the middle, with a bus station to the west and a car park to the east. In addition, new housing will be constructed in the north-east and south-east, while the existing part and school will remain in their current locations.
