## **📝 范文（60–90 秒）**

I’d like to talk about a really memorable trip I had.  
It happened last summer, when I had a short break between projects.  
I still remember it clearly because it was the first time I had truly relaxed in months.

I went to Sanya with two close friends, both of whom I met in university.  
Basically, what happened was that we booked a last-minute flight and decided to just “disappear” from work for a few days.

There were a few details that stood out.  
First, the weather was perfect — sunny but not too hot.  
Second, we spent an entire afternoon on the beach doing nothing but swimming, talking, and drinking coconut juice.  
Another detail I remember clearly was watching the sunset.  
The sky was orange and purple, and it felt like time slowed down.

I felt incredibly relaxed and recharged.  
The trip meant a lot to me because it reminded me that even when life gets stressful, I can always take a break and reconnect with people I care about.
