   I’d like to talk about a person who has had a significant influence on me, and that person is **my university teacher**, who taught me during my undergraduate studies.
   
   I first got to know him in my second year at university, when he was teaching a course related to **problem-solving and logical thinking**. Unlike many other teachers, he didn’t just focus on exams or textbooks. Instead, he encouraged us to think independently and question what we were learning.
   
   What impressed me most was the way he taught. Rather than giving us direct answers, he often asked questions and guided us to find solutions on our own. He also shared real-world examples and talked about how knowledge could be applied outside the classroom, which made learning much more practical and meaningful.
   
   This person has influenced me because he changed the way I think and learn. I became more confident in forming my own opinions and more willing to explore new ideas. Even now, I still use the mindset he taught me when I face challenges, both in my studies and in daily life.
